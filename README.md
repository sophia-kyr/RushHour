# RushHour
Encoded 2D computer game based on a childhood favorite of mine, called Rush Hour. The game board is a grid full of cars in various positions. Their movements are limited to up/down and left/right, and avoiding hitting the other cars. The goal is to maneuver the cars to allow the target red car to reach the exit.
